# Helmet Detection System

This is a real-time helmet detection system that utilizes a YOLO model and a custom CNN to detect whether individuals are wearing helmets in videos or webcam streams.

## Features
- Detect helmets in video files and live webcam streams.
- Uses YOLO for object detection.
- CNN for classifying helmet and non-helmet.

   git clone https://github.com/TanayChawda-1011/helmet-detection-yolov3.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd helmet-detection-system
  ```

## Usage
Video Input: You can select a video file to run the detection on
Webcam Input: You can use the live webcam to detect helmets in real-time. Run the following command:

## Technologies
